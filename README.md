# AccountingSystem
Hi! This is an accounting system made for a final project of an accounting subject of my university. It's made in C# based on 
layered architecture pattern connected to a MySQL database. The script of the database is on the repo and already has data on it. 
In order to make it work, you'll have to create first the database with the name "reto" then import the sql script that i leave on the repo,
so you can fill the database with tables, procedures, data and that kind of stuff and at the end you will able to pass the login. 
You can find the credencials on the database table named "usuario" with the user named "admin".

Hope you enjoy it!! ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š
btw it's in Spanish... ğŸ˜…
